Hi Paola!

Great work, as you can see below you've ticked all thhe boxes so it's a 10/10, Välgodkänt! Well done!

Excellent file organisation, and nice use of the morph animation.

There's a few missed indents and empty lines, which are pretty minor. Just make sure that any img tag has an 'alt' attribute. This is really iportant for google rankings.
